# Privacy Policy

GoblinTasks collects no user data, and never sells it. (this will never change.)
However, you might want to consult the Privacy Policy of the analytics tool used: [Plausible](https://plausible.io/privacy)
And the privacy policy of [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies) (used for authentication to the web-app itself) and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/trust/privacy/privacy-policy) (used for integration with a Slack Bot that tells your peers when you complete a task, only for Hack Club Members right now)
Please do not put any PII into your todos- data is currently not encrypted at rest on my server.
